## Basic quantities
$T$ length of observation period
$B$ amount of time in which the system is busy
$C$ Number of completions
$A$ Number of arrivals

### Derived quantities
$\lambda = \frac{A}{T}$  job/sec -> arrival rate
$X= \frac{C}{T}$ output rate
$U= \frac{B}{T}$ utilization 
$S = \frac{B}{C}$ mean service time


### Saturation
$U = X*S$  -> utilization law
$A = C$  -> flow balance| operational equilibrium
$U= \lambda*S$ 

Saturation: $U \leq 1$ -> $X \leq  \frac{1}{S}$  and $\lambda \leq \frac{1}{S}$ 
if $X = \frac{1}{S}$  the system is saturated ^1c8519
## Customer quantities
$a_k$  = the arrival of the k-th customer
$c_k$ = instant in which leaves the system (must be $c_k \gt a_k \geq 0$)
$w_k = c_k - a_k$ waiting time for k-th customer
$\bar{w} = \frac{1}{C} \sum^{C}_{k=1}{w_k}$ average waiting time
## Little's formula

$\bar{n} = X*\bar{w}$ -> waiting law
$\bar{n} = \lambda*\bar{w}$ -> little's formula

![[Pasted image 20231001123801.png]]

 little formula without op eq
$\bar{n} = \frac{G(T)}{T}$  and $\bar{w} = \frac{G(T)}{A(T)}$  --> $\bar{n} = \frac{A(T)}{G(T)} \bar{w} X$ 

## Network of queue
i = 1,...,M -> index for each station in the network. 0 is the outside(or whole system).

$U_i= X_iS_i$ , $X_0= \frac{C_0}{T}$ , $\lambda_0 = \frac{A_0}{T}$  --> in op eq. $\lambda_0 = X_0$ 
$V_i$  number of service request for queue i $V_i = \frac{C_i}{C_0}$ 
$D_i$ total service (time) demand for i $D_i = V_iS_i=\frac{B_i}{C_0}$ 


### Consistency law
$X_0 = \frac{C_0}{T} =\frac{1}{V_i}X_i = \frac{X_i}{V_i}$  -> X in terms of visits
$X_0 = \frac{C_0}{T} = \frac{1}{D_i} = \frac{U_i}{D_i}$  -> X in terms of utilization
it follows $\frac{X_i}{X_j} = \frac{V_i}{V_j}$ and $\frac{U_i}{U_j} = \frac{V_iS_i}{V_jS_j} = \frac{D_i}{D_j}$ . 
X and U depend in general on the load of the system , relative values remains stable while change from station to station.
V are characteristics of each client

### Matrix representation

$C_i$ number of departures from station i
$C_{i,j}$ number of customers that move from i to j
it follows $C_i=\sum^{M}_{j=0}{C_{i,j}}$ 

$q_{i,j} = \frac{C_{i,j}}{C_i}$ transition frequency from i to j
it follows $\frac{C_{i,j}}{T} = q_{i, j}X_i$ 

if op eq -> $A_i = C_i$, then  $X_j = \sum^{M}_{i=0}{X_iq_{i,j}}$  --> can be written as $\boldsymbol{X}= \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{Q}$   
where $\textbf{X} = (X_0,...,X_M)$  --> vector of M+1 components
$\textbf{Q}$ square matrix (M+1) x (M+1) filled with  $q_{i,j} = \frac{C_{i,j}}{C_i}$ , this matrix characterize the system. it follows that
$\frac{X_j}{X_0}  = \sum^{M}_{i=0}\frac{X_i}{X_0}q_{i,j}$ --> rewrite of flow balance equation

#### little law for Network of queues
using $V_j=\frac{X_j}{X_0}$  and knowing $V_0 = 1$ is possible to define $\textbf{V} = \textbf{V}\textbf{Q}$ that can be used to describe the system. this is possible because of the Consistency Laws. it follows also that $\bar{n_i} = X_i\bar{w_i}$  where $\bar{n_i}$ are mean number of customers and $\bar{w_i}$ are the mean waiting times.

## load dependency
- $T(n)$ time spent by the system with n customers inside
- $K_{max}$  maximum number of customers  simultaneously present inside the system 

$T = \sum^{K_{max}}_{n=0}T(n)$  and $B=T-T(0)$  

#### load dependent behaviour

$\phi(k) = \frac{T(k)}{T}$    $k=0,...,K_{max}$  -> fraction of time spent by the system in each state

$C(k)$ -> number of completions with k customers in the systems  -> $\sum^{K_{max}}_{k=1}{C(k)} = C$ 

$S(k) = \frac{T(k)}{C(k)}$ -> load dependent mean service time or service function 

$X = \sum^{K_{max}}_{k=1}{\frac{1}{S(k)}{\phi(k)}}$  generalized throughput

### load dependent behaviour for queues
$T_i(k)$ time spent at the i station with k customers inside (i=1,...,M) 
we can then write $\sum^{K_{max}}_{k=0}T_i(k) = T$  (i=0,...,M) and then we can define 
$\phi_i(k) = \frac{T_i(k)}{T}$ the fraction of time spent by each station with k customers. 

Let $C_i(k)$  (i=1,...,M) be the number of completions from the i-th station with k customers inside, also in this case $\sum^{K_{max}}_{k=1}C_i(k)=C_i$   (i=0,..,M)
Trivially we can define again $S_i(k)= \frac{T_i(k)}{C_i(k)}$  (i=0,...,M;k=1,...,$K_{max}$)  

and again $X_i=\sum^{K_{max}}_{k=1}\frac{1}{S_i(k)}\phi_i(k)$  (i=0,...,M)

## Response time

with $V_i$ and $\bar{w_i}$ we can compute the amount of time taken by customers to go through the system (response time).

2 types of system:
- Open System: new customers enter with rate $\lambda$ . The number of customers can grow to $\infty$ . If the system is not saturated $X_0 = \lambda$ 
- Closed System: fixed number of N customers is present in the system. Customers leaving are replaced with new customers
### Response time: Closed
N customers in system, index i=0 is meaningless and visits must be computed using a generic index k inside the system (arbitrary station) so $\Omega_i$ are dependent on k.

$R_k = \sum^{i=1,i \neq k}_{M}{\Omega_i}$  average amount of time taken by customers to return to station k (Response time).

$Y_k = \bar{w_k}+R_k = \sum^{M}_{i=1}{\Omega_i}$  average amount of time take by a customer to make a complete tour in the system starting from station k (cycle time).

if we generalize taking in consideration explicitly the station K
$V_j^{[k]} = \frac{C_j}{C_k} = \frac{X_j}{X_k} = \sum^{M}_{i=1}V_i^{[k]}q_{i,j}$          $j=1,...,m$    
we can relate this notation referring to a second station h
$V_j^{[h]} = \frac{C_j}{C_h} = \frac{V_j^{[k]}}{V_h^{[k]}}$              $j,h,k=1,...,M$ 
and for this chosen station we can compute 
$Y_k = \sum^{M}_{i=1}{\Omega_i}^{[k]} = \sum^{M}_{i=1}{V_i^{[k]}}\bar{w_i}$  
and also 
$Y_h = \sum^{M}_{i=1}\Omega_i^{[h]} = Y_k\frac{1}{V_h^{[k]}}$  and obtaining the general form
$R_h = Y_h - \bar{w_h}$ 


### Closed system with delay station
$Z$ average delay of station 0, using the delay station to compute visits counts (as reference station). We can write
$R_0 = \sum^{M}_{i=1}{\Omega_i}$ ,  $Y_0= Z+R_0$. In whole system the number of customers is constant, so using little law's on the black box:
![[Pasted image 20231001173621.png]]

in operational eq. we have $X_0=\frac{A_0}{T} = \frac{C_0}{T}$. And denoting $\bar{n_d}$ the avg number of customers in the delay station and $\bar{n_{cs}}$ the avg number of customer in the central system we have.

$N=X_0Y_0= X_0(Z+R)= \bar{n_d} + \bar{n_{cs}}$ . it follows $R_0 = \frac{N_{cs}}{X_0} - Z$ 
$U= n_{cs}/N$ 

### Response time: Open 

$\Omega_i=V_i\bar{w_i}$ (i=1,...,M) average time spent by customer in queue i
$R = \sum^{M}_{i=1}\Omega_i$  average response time of the system (or average response time spent by customer in the system).

using little law's
$\bar{n}=\lambda R=\sum^{M}_{i=1}X_i\bar{w_i}= \sum^{M}_{i=1}{\lambda \Omega_i}=\sum^{M}_{i=1}\bar{n_i}$ 

## Bottleneck Analysis
using $V_i$ and $S_i$  we can observe the behaviour of the system under stress condition ($\lambda$ grow in case of open system and $N$ grow  in case of closed system).  

### Bottleneck Analysis: open systems
$S_i$ and $V_i$ are independent of $\lambda$. The same is not true for $X_i$ and $U_i$ so they can be represented as function of $\lambda$ --> $X_i(\lambda)$ and $U_i(\lambda)$. For the Consistency Law we have $\frac{X_i(\lambda)}{X_j(\lambda)} = \frac{V_i}{V_j}$ and $\frac{U_i}{U_j} = \frac{V_iS_i}{V_jS_j}$ , independent from $\lambda$. it follows then 
$\lambda_i = \lambda_0V_i$ and in op.eq $\lambda \leq \frac{1}{S_i}$ (i=1,...,M).  And so $X_i(\lambda) = \lambda_i = \lambda_0V_i$ and $U_i(\lambda) = X_i(\lambda)S_i$ .

Denote with b the first station to reach 1 of utilization. This station is the Bottleneck of the system  and is used to identify the value of $\lambda_{max}$ after which the system loses the operation eq. property. If $\lambda>\lambda_{max}$ the system reach a point in which the queues grow to infinity and the system becomes unstable. Since $\frac{U_i(\lambda)}{U_j(\lambda)}$ is fixed for any pair i,j then the station that becomes saturated first is whose the utilization becomes the largest in any loading conditions. Formally: $\frac{U_b(\lambda)}{U_i(\lambda)}=\frac{V_bS_b}{V_iS_i}=\frac{D_b}{D_i} > 1$, in order to identify the index of the bottleneck $V_bS_b=max_i(V_iS_i)$ , then we can state the maximum throughput of the bottleneck station $X_b^{[max]}(\lambda)=\frac{U_b^{[max]}(\lambda)}{S_b} = \frac{1}{S_b}$ --> $\lambda_{max}=\frac{1}{V_bS_b}$ 

### Beyond $\lambda_{max}$ (asymptotic analysis)
in certain cases is possible for $\lambda$ to grow beyond $\lambda_{max}$. This may yield to saturation also the other stations that have $V_iS_i < V_bS_b$ (depend on topology). 2 cases can arise:
1) $V_iS_i > V_jS_j$  $\forall j > i; i,j=1,2,...,M$  in this network b = 1 and only the first station can have $U = 1$ 
2) $V_iS_i \leq V_jS_j$   $\forall j > i; i,j=1,2,...,M$  in this network b=M and all the queues can have $U=1$  if $\lambda$ becomes sufficiently large. 

in both cases $X \leq \frac{1}{S_b}$  independently of $\lambda$

![[Pasted image 20231002213059.png]]

### Bottleneck Analysis: closed systems
Assume that $S_i$ and $V_i$ are independent of the load system $N$, and concentrate the analysis on $X$ $U$ and $Y$  --> $X_i(N)$ ,$U_i(N)$ and $Y(N)$ (valid for the whole system) that are dependent. Consistency law is valid also there
$\frac{X_i(N)}{X_j(N)} = \frac{V_i}{V_j}$ and $\frac{U_i(N)}{U_j(N)} = \frac{V_iS_i}{V_jS_j}$ independently of N.

denote with b the station whose $U=1$ first when $N$ grows, this is the bottleneck of the network, since $\frac{U_i(N)}{U_j(N)}$ is fixed for all station i,j=1,2,...,M. The station that becomes saturated first is the one whose $U$ is largest in any loading conditions 
$\frac{U_b}{U_i}>1$ i=1,...,M $i \neq b$  so that $V_bS_b=max_i(V_iS_i)$  

#### Asymptotic analysis for closed systems
large values of $N$ yield $U \approxeq 1$ and $X_i(N) \approxeq \frac{1}{S_i}$, all the $V_i$ are computed on an arbitrary chosen station k, then the throughput of the system is $X_k(N) = \frac{U_b(N)}{V_bS_b} \approxeq \frac{1}{V_bS_b}$  the value derived is the possible maximum throughput of the station, is then possible to write 
$\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}X_i(N)=\frac{1}{V_bS_b}$. using $D_i$ as the total average service time received by station i describe $D=\sum^{i=1}_{M}V_iS_i = \sum^{i=1}_{M}D_i$ as the total average time for a client to make a tour of the system (in this case N=1). D is then the cycle time of the system $D = Y(1)$ with little formula we can state $X_k(1)= \frac{1}{Y(1)}$ , if the networks is build so that the station doesn't interfere with each other then $Y(N)=Y(1)$  and $X_k(N)=\frac{N}{Y(N)}= \frac{N}{Y(1)}$.

The intersection among the asymptotes identify a unique saturation point $N^*=\frac{Y(1)}{V_bS_b}$. Similarly for the cycle time is possible to note $Y(N)=\frac{N}{X_k(N)}$ with $Y(1)$ as lower limit and $Y'(N)=N*V_bS_b$ which is a second lower limit (slanting asymptote).

![[Pasted image 20231003110041.png]]

### Bottleneck analysis: case with load dependent behaviour
in order to extend the analysis, we can remove the constant constraint from $S_i$, that now became $S_i(N)$ , this is possible only if this function has an upper bound limit for $N \rightarrow \infty$ .
Using $S_i(1) \leq S_i^{[max]} = \lim_{h->\infty} S_i(h)$ , the discussion made for closed system  $D=Y(1)=\sum^{i=1}_{M}V_iS_i = \sum^{i=1}_{M}D_i$ and $Y(N)=NV_bS_b$  can be generalized to 
$Y(1) = \sum^{i=1}_{M}V_iS_i$ and $Y(N)=NV_bS_b^{[max]}$  --> $V_bS_b^{[max]} = max_i(V_iS_i)^{[max]}$. If the service speed of i goes to 0 all the customers will be blocked by that station so this discussion  is not valid, and so is a generalization for all the stations whose service speed is not an increasing function of the load. 

NOTE: the expression for D is equal to R(1).

#### Case of queues with load dependent behaviour
using $S_i(1) \geq S_i^{[min]} = \lim_{h \rightarrow \infty} S_i(h)$ , the discussion can now be generalized in $Y(1) = \sum^{i=1}_{M}V_iS_i(1)$ and $Y(N)=NV_bS_b^{[min]}$  the problem now is that $Y(1) = \sum_{i=1}^{M}V_iS_i(1)$ can be larger that the minimum cycle of the network

#needclarify
note: is not clear what min is referring to

#### Case of infinite server 
infinite Server stations are such that their service function is $S_i(h)= \frac{S_i(1)}{h} = \frac{Z}{h}$. Because of this, the load dependent service speeds are non-decreasing, but also not limited so that these station cannot be bottlenecks because their limit service times are equal to 0. **They must be skipped during the search of a bottleneck**.

![[Pasted image 20231003212636.png]]

Let's study the case of a central server time sharing composed by N terminals connected to the central server. Assume that Z represent the delay associated with the terminal station and that $S_i$ and $V_i$ are constant. What would be the impact on the behavior if we connect more terminals. The response can be found using the delay station as reference to calculate the performance of the others in the systems.

in this case we have $Y(N) = Z+R(N)$  where R is the response time with N terminals connected. The slanted asymptote for $X(N)$ is given by $X'(N)= \frac{N}{Y(1)} = \frac{N}{[Z+R(1)]}$ on the other hand $X$ is bounded by horizontal asymptote $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}X_0(N)=\frac{1}{V_bS_b}$.

The saturation point is $N^*= \frac{Z}{V_bS_b}+\frac{R(1)}{V_bS_b}$ considering cycle and response time we have 
$Y(N)=\frac{N}{X(N)} \geq \frac{N}{1/V_bS_b} = NV_bS_b$ consequently the slanted asymptote for the response time is $R'(N)= N(V_bS_b) - Z$ 


# Operational Analysis: intermediate state  

## Intermediate state
steady state analysis is not enough to understand the behavior of the system in intermediate conditions, additional measure are needed. 
The state of the system can be represented with a vector $\underline{n} = (n_1,n_2,...,n_m)$  $n_i \geq 0$  $i=1,2,...,M$  the set of all the possible state is called state space $S(M)$     


## State balance of a single queue
assume that the state are defined on the base of the number of customer waiting in the queue with states k,m,n.

let $C(m,n)$ = number of transitions from state m to state n, then the state balance equation is $\sum_{k}C(n,k)= \sum_mC(n,m)$ .  This holds in general for all state but for first and last, except when in Operational equilibrium, then it holds for all states.

![[Pasted image 20231006125755.png]]


### State balance measures

$r(n,m)=\frac{C(n,m)}{T(n)}$ => transition rate from m to n, while n is occupied
$p(n)=\frac{T(n)}{T}$ fraction of time spent by the system with n customers waiting

the state balance equation can be rewritten with $\sum_kp(k)r(k,n)=p(n)\sum_mr(n,m) \space |\forall n$    
### Balance equations

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      p(1)r(1,0)=p(0)r(0,1)\\
      \\
      p(n-1)r(n-1,n)+p(n+1)r(n+1,n)=p(n)[r(n,n+1)+r(n,n-1)]\ \ \ \ 0<n<N \\
      \\
      p(N-1)r(N-1,N)=p(N)r(N,N-1) \\
      \\
      \sum_np(n)=1
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$

#### Simplify transition rates (Balance equations)
using
- $C(n,n+1)= A(n)$ = # arrivals observed when the system is in state n; $A(N)=0$
- $C(n,n-1)=C(n)$ = # completions observed when the system is in state n; $C(0)=0$

we can generalize to 
$r(n,n+1)= \frac{A(n)}{T(n)}= \lambda(n)$
$r(n,n-1)= \frac{C(n)}{T(n)}= \micro(n)$ 

#### Result
the system can now be rewritten as
$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    p(n)\micro(n)=p(n-1)\lambda(n-1) \ \ \ 0<n \leq N \\
    \\
    \sum_np(n)=1
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$

nb this is the final form, you can take the other system and perform the substitution to see the intermediate one
 

### Solution: load dependent rates 
the previous solution provide a new interesting relationship 
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
p(n) = p(0)\prod^{n}_{k=1}\frac{\lambda(k-1)}{\micro(k)} \ \ \ 0<n \leq N \\ 
\\
p(0)= (1+\sum^{N}_{n=1}[\prod^{n}_{k=1}\frac{\lambda(k-1)}{\micro(k)}])^{-1}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$
and performance indices

- $X= \sum^{N}_{n=1}p(n)\micro(n)$ 
- $\bar{n} = \sum^{N}_{n=1}np(n)$ 
- $\bar{W}=\frac{\bar{n}}{X}$ 

### Solution: homogeneous 
arrival rates are independent from the state of the system 
$\lambda(0)= \lambda(1)...=\lambda(N-1)=\lambda$
service rates are also indipendent of the state of the system 
$\micro(1)=\micro(2)...=\micro(N)=\micro$

we can define $\rho=\frac{\lambda}{\micro}$ and conclude that $p(n)= \frac{1-\rho}{1-\rho^{N+1}}\rho^n \ \ \ 0\leq n \leq N$  
#### Asymptotic homogeneous performance indices

when $\rho < 1$ taking the limit for N that goes to $\infty$ we observe that the fraction of time spent by the system in each of its possible states assume the connotation of a probability
$p(n)= (1-\rho)\rho^n$ 

we can then derive 
- throughput $X= \lambda$ 
- average queue length $\bar{n}=\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$ 
- average waiting time $\bar{W} = \frac{1}{\micro(1-\rho)}$ 


## Generalization 
suppose that measurement of service rates change for possible values of the state k. The result obtained can be summarized in the following manner:

- Discouraged arrivals
- Multiple Server queue 
- infinite server queue 
- queue with a finite waiting room
- queue with fixed population

### Discouraged arrivals 
$\lambda(k)=\frac{\lambda}{k+1}$ , $\micro(k)=\micro \ \ k \geq 1$  from this result we obtain 

$p(n)= p(0)\prod^{n-1}_{k=0}\frac{\lambda/(k+1)}{\micro}=p(0)(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{1}{n!}$  

p(0) can be computed using its explicit expression 

$$
p(0)= [1+ \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{1}{n!}]^{-1}=e^\frac{-\lambda}{\micro}
$$  
and then 

$$
p(n)= \frac{(\lambda/\micro)^n}{n!}e^\frac{-\lambda}{\micro} 
$$



### Infinite server queue 
$\lambda(k) = \lambda$ , $\micro(k) = k \micro$ 
distribution of number of customers 
$$
p(n)=p(0) \prod^{n-1}_{k=0}\frac{\lambda}{(k+1)\micro} = p(0)(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{1}{n!} 
$$
a simple expression for p(0) can be obtained for $N \rightarrow \infty$ 
$p(0) = [1+\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{1}{n!}]^{-1} = e^{-\lambda/\micro}$ 
and the general expression becomes then 
$$
p(n) = \frac{(\lambda/\micro)^n}{n!}e^\frac{-\lambda}{\micro}
$$

### Multiple server queue 
$\lambda(k) = \lambda$  , $\micro(k)= \begin{equation} \begin{cases}  k \micro \ \ \ 0 \leq k \leq m \\ m \micro \ \ m<k \end{cases} \end{equation}$   
the distribution of the number of customers is then 
$$
p(n) = 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
p(0)\prod^{n-1}_{k=0} \frac{\lambda}{(k+1)\micro} = p(0)(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{1}{n!} \ \ \ 0 \leq n \leq m \\
\\
p(0) \prod^{m-1}_{k=0} \frac{\lambda}{(k+1)\micro} \prod^{n-1}_{k=m} \frac{\lambda}{m \micro} = p(0)(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{1}{m!m^{n-m}} \ \ \ m<n
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$
p(0) can be derived from normalization, or obtained taking the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ under the assumption that $\frac{\lambda}{m \micro} < 1$ 

### queue with a finite waiting room

$\lambda(k) = \begin{cases} \lambda \ \ \ 0 \leq k \leq B \\ 0 \ \ \ k>B\end{cases}$  , $\micro(k)= \micro$ 
we obtain 
$$
p(n) = \begin{cases}
p(0) \prod^{n-1}_{k=0} \frac{\lambda}{\micro} = p(0) (\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \ \ \ 0 \leq n \leq B 
\\
0
\end{cases}
$$
in this case $p(0)= \frac{1-\lambda/\micro}{1-(\lambda/\micro)^{B+1}}$
and the general expression becomes 
$$
p(n) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1-\lambda/\micro}{1-(\lambda/\micro)^{B+1}} \ \ \ 0 \leq n \leq B
\\0 \ \ \ n> B
\end{cases}
$$


### Single queue with fixed number of customers
$\lambda(k)= \begin{cases}(N-k)\lambda \ \ \ 0 \leq k \leq N \\ 0 \ \ \ k > N\end{cases}$, $\micro(k)= \micro$ 
 we have 
$$
p(n)= \begin{cases}
p(0) \prod^{n-1}_{k=0}\frac{(N-k)\lambda}{\micro} = p(0)(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{N!}{(N-n)!} \ \ \ 0 \leq n \leq N \\
0 \ \ \ n > N
\end{cases}
$$
from which we can derive 
$p(0) = [1+\sum^{N}_{n=1}(\frac{\lambda}{\micro})^n \frac{N!}{(N-n)!}]^{-1}$  


## One step behavior

![[Pasted image 20231006152829.png]]
since $T(n)$ sum to $T$ we can add the normalization condition $\sum_np(n)=1$. in this way the unique changes that can happen is the arrival or the departure of a customer.

## State balance of a network of queues
set of all possible states $S(M) = \{\underline{n} =(n_1,n_2,...,n_M), n_i \geq 0 i=1,2,...,M\}$  

$\underline{k}, \underline{m}$ and $\underline{n}$ will be generic states.

### Intermediate behavior
$T(n)$ = total time spent by the system in state $\underline{n}$ during observation period, with $\sum T(n) = T$. 
Let $P(n)= T(n)/T$ be the fraction of time spent by the system in state $\underline{n}$. 

the set of fractions of time spent by the system in each state in $S(M)$ or $\{P(\underline{n}), \underline{n} \in S(M)\}$ is called "distribution of the fractions of time spent by the system in its states". The objective is to derive P(n) not through direct measures but by using the parameters of the model. 

let $C(\underline{n}, \underline{m})$ be # of direct transition made by the system from state $\underline{n}$ to state $\underline{m}$. In our measurement we can't observe transition within the same state so $C(\underline{n},\underline{n}) = 0$ for any n

### Operational equilibrium : steady state
also in this case $A=C$ is required for every station. The number of departures and arrivals must be $n_i(0)= n_i(T) \ \ \  i=1...M$.

this means that the op eq condition is satisfied every time the measurement start with a state and ends with that state. For a single server in isolation then 
$$
\sum_kC(\underline{k},\underline{n}) = \sum_mC(\underline{n},\underline{m}) \ \ \ \forall \underline{n}
$$

then we can say "the flow balance condition among customer of a system is equivalent to balancing the number of transition among the  state of the system" 

Define now the transition rate from n to m as $r(\underline{n},\underline{m})= \frac{C(\underline{n},\underline{m})}{T(\underline{n})}$ . 
$T(\underline{n})=0$ implies $C(\underline{n}, \underline{m})=0$. Now we can introduce those variables in balance equation 
$$
\sum_\underline{k} P(\underline{k})r(\underline{k},\underline{n}) = P(\underline{n}) \sum_\underline{m}r(\underline{n},\underline{m}) 
$$
the definition of P(n) allows to add a normalization equation 
$\sum_\underline{n}P(\underline{n})=1$ 

### Derived Measures (One step behaviour)
denoting with H the total number of equations of this system, his value can be $H=(N_{max}+1)^M$  and $H = \binom{N+M-1}{M-1}$  in the case of a open system with Nmax customers observed or closed with N respectively.

According to the one step behavior hypothesis the transition can occur only within adjacent states.  Let's introduce the following definitions 
$\underline{n_{ij}} = (n_1,...,n_i+1,...,n_j-1,...,n_M)$ 
$\underline{n_{i0}} = (n_1,...,n_i+1,...,n_j,...,n_M)$ 
$\underline{n_{0j}} = (n_1,...,n_i,...,n_j-1,...,n_M)$ 
that we can use to indicates the states that are adjacent to 
$\underline{n} = (n_1,...,n_i,...,n_j,...,n_M)$ 


### Homogeneity
1) the output of a station of the system is completely determined by the length of its input queue, but independent of the length of the others stations.
2) the transition frequencies among the stations of the system are independent of the state of the system and may depend at most on the total load of the system(N)

### Simplify state transition balance equation (homogeneity)

First part of hypothesis allows to simplify the definition of the state transition rates in 
$$
r(\bar{n},\bar{n}_{ij})=\frac{C_{ij}(n_{j})}{T_{j}(n_{j})}
$$
the second part implies that $C_{ji}(n_{j})=C_{j(n_{j})}q_{ji}$
so that overall we obtain 
$$
r(\bar{n},\bar{n}_{ij})= 
\begin{cases}
\frac{q_{ji}}{S_{j(n_{j})}}  &  j \rightarrow i  \\
\frac{q_{j_{0}}}{S_{j}(n_{j})} & j \rightarrow 0 \\
\lambda_{0i}  &  0 \rightarrow i
\end{cases}
$$


let's introduce an indicator function defined in this way $\sigma(n)= \begin{cases}1 \ \ \ n>0 \\0 \ \ \ n=0\end{cases}$ 
using $\lambda_{0j}$ as the external arrival rate directed toward the station of index j
With all those hypothesis the transition balance equations assume the following form 
$$
\sum^{M}_{i,j=1}P(\underline{n}_{ij}) \frac{q_{ij}}{S_i(n_i+1)}\sigma(n_j) + \sum^{M}_{j=1}P(\underline{n}_{0j})\lambda_{0j}\sigma(n_j) + \sum^{M}_{i=1}P(\underline{n}_{i0})\frac{q_{i0}}{S_i(n_i+1)}= P(\underline{n})[\sum^{M}_{i=1}\frac{\sigma(n_i)}{S_i(n_i)} +  \sum^{M}_{j=1}\lambda_{0j}]
$$

## Solving transition balance 
assume all the $V_i$ are computed so that we can assume $\lambda_i=\begin{cases}\lambda V_i \ \ \ open\ system \\ V_i \ \ \ closed\ system \end{cases}$ , where $\lambda$ represent the total arrival rate of external customers to the system.  Define also the following function 
$$
f_i(k)= \begin{cases}
1 \ \ \ k = 0 \\
\lambda_iS_i(k)f_i)k-1 \ \ \ k>0
\end{cases}
$$
is it possible to show that the time spent by the system in each of its states is $$P(\underline{n})= \frac{1}{G} \prod^{M}_{i=1}f_i(n_i)$$
This is called product form solution , G is a normalization constant defined in this way 
$$
1= \sum_{\underline{n}}P(\underline{n}) = \frac{1}{G}\sum_{\underline{n}}\prod^{M}_{i=1}f_i(n_i) \rightarrow G= \sum_{\underline{n}}\prod^{M}_{i=1}f_i(n_i)
$$
### Queue length distribution 

using the recursive expression of $p(\underline{n})$ we obtain (no intermediary)
$$
\begin{cases}
P(\underline{n}_{i0}) = \lambda_iS_i(n_i+1)P(\underline{n}) \\
\\
P(\underline{n}_{0j}) = \frac{1}{\lambda_jS_j(n_j)}\\
\\
P(\underline{n}_{ij}) = \frac{\lambda_iS_i(n_i+1)}{\lambda_jS_j(n_j)}P(\underline{n})
\end{cases}
$$

define the number of distribution of the number of customer at station 
$$
p_i(k) = \sum_{\underline{n_{n_i = k}}}P(\underline{n})
$$
recall $F(k)= \lambda S(k)f(k-1)$ for k>0 and F(0)=1
- Case 1: Single server queue $p(n)=p(0)F(n)$    n>0
- Case 2: Single Server queue embedded in Open network $P_M(n)=\frac{1}{G_M}F_M(n)$ n>0
- Case 3: Single Server queue in closed netork $P_M(n)=\frac{g(N-m,M-1)}{G(N,M)}F_M(n)$    $0 \leq n \leq N$ 
in Case 1 the normalizing constant p(0) is different from zero if the queue is stable
$\lambda*S(k)<1$  for k>k0
in Case 2 the normalizing constant Gm is != 0 if the queue is stable $\lambda_M*S_m(k)<1$ 
in Case 3 the normalization factor is not constant.

We then obtain the following performance indices 

- $X_i=\sum^{n}_{k=1}p_i(k)\frac{1}{S_i(k)}$ 
- $U_i=1-P_i(0)$ 
- $\overline{n}_i=\sum_kkp_i(k)$ 
- $\overline{w_i} = \frac{n_i}{X_i}$ 

### The BCMP theorem
A queueing network has a product form solution if it satisfies the following criteria:
- The network has a finite number of stations 
- Customer belong to an arbitrary and finite number of closed or open classes and can change class memberships
- Routing probability are defined for each class identified by a DTMC (markov chain) (so as a matrix)
- The station of the network may be of 4 different types:
	- FCFS with negative exponential distribution of service times
	- LCFS with a rationale laplace transform distribution of service times 
	- Processor Sharing with a rationale laplace transform distribution of service times 
	- Infinite server with a rationale laplace transform distribution of service times

FCFS is commonly associated to negative exponential distribution, this is the standard first come first served policy.

LCFSpr (preemptive resume) last come first served: studied as a simple approximation of server undergoing high priority interruptions. When a new customer join a non empty queue, the customer in service is interrupted, pushed into an input stack and resumed later.

PS Process sharing discipline: represent a limit for the round robin discipline as its quantum size goes to 0

IS infinte server discipline makes the server equivalent to a delay station.

## Computing normalization constant in open systems 

Denote with $N_i,i=1,...,M$ the maximum number of customers observed at station i during all observation (0,T].
In the case of open systems those $N_i$ can be arbitrarily large (and in fact grow to infinity). This means that there is not dependency among $N_i$ so the normalization constant G becomes .
$$
G=\sum_\underline{n}\prod^{M}_{i=1}f_i(n_i) = \prod^{M}_{i=1}\sum^{N_i}_{i=1}f_i(n_i) = \prod^{M}_{i=1}G_i
$$
and then the product form solution become 
$$
P(\underline{n}) = \frac{1}{G} \prod^{M}_{i=1}f_i(n_i)=\prod^{M}_{i=1}\frac{f_i(n_i)}{G_i} = \prod^{M}_{i=1}p_i(n_i) 
$$
## Computing normalization constant in closed systems 

The indipendece of $N_i$ doesn´t apply for closed network. In closed systems there aren't new arrivals, so the only possibility are customers that move from one station to another. The global balance equations assumes a much simpler form. 
$$
\sum^{M}_{i,j=1}P(\underline{n_{ij}})\frac{q_{ij}\delta(n_j)}{S_i(n_i+1)}=P(\underline{n})\sum^{M}_{i=1}\frac{\delta(n_i)}{S_i(n_i)}
$$

the formal definitions remains the same.  for G: $P(\underline{n}) = \frac{1}{G}\prod^{M}_{i=1}f_i(n_i)$  where 
$$
f_i(k)= \begin{cases}
1 \ \ \ k=0 \\
V_iS_i(k)f_i(k-1) \ \ k>0
\end{cases}
$$
and $G = \sum_\underline{n}\prod^{M}_{i=1}f_i(n_i)$ 

### The Convolution method
In a closed system a state $\underline{n}$ is feasible if $n_i \geq 0,i=1\dots M$  and $\sum^{M}_{i=1}n_i=N$ the second condition introduce dependency among the stations of the system.

for convenience let's define the state space of the system with m station and n customers as
$$
S(n,m)=\{(n_1 \dots n_M | n_i \geq 0, i=1 \dots m; \sum^{m}_{i=1}n_i=n \}
$$
define the following auxiliary function $g(n,m)= \sum_{\underline{n} \in S(n,m)} \prod^{m}_{i=1}f_i(n_i)$  with $g(N,M)=G$ 
with a little manipulation is possible to prove that 
$$
g(n,m) = \sum^{n}_{k=0}f_m(k)g(n-k,m-1) 
$$
the definition of g(n,m) can be made recursive introducing the following base conditions
$g(0,m) = 1(m=0 \dots )$ and $g(n,0) = 0 (n=1 \dots)$. This definition is a convolution sum (Convolution algorithm) used for compute the normalization constant in efficient manner. 

### Computational Scheme for G
in order for this scheme to work we must have first computed all the values of $f_m(k)$ and of $g(k,m-1)$ , every row of the recursion of g correspond to a specific load of the system and every column correspond to a specific station. The recursion is made first on the loading level (n) and then on the components of the network(m) starting from the upper left corner and ending to the bottom right.
The complexity of the computation is in order of : $N^2*M$  in the general case and $N*M$ if all the stations are load indipendent (is much simpler to calculate). 
```
//Input -> M: int,N: int,V[i]: Array<double>, S[i](k): Array<Array<double>>, ST[i]: Array<SType>
//Output -> G(k): Array<double>

G[0] = 1.0;
for k in 1...N{
	G[k]= 0.0;
}
for i in 1...M{
	if(ST[i] == LI){
		d = V[i] * S[i][1];
		for k in 1...N{
			G[k] = G[k] + d*G[k-1];
		}
	}

	else{
		f[0] = 1.0
		for k in 1...N{
			f[k] = f[k-1]*V[i]*S[i][k];
		}
		for n in N...1{
			sum = G[n];
			for k in 1...n{
				sum += f[k] * G[n-k];
			}
		}
	}
}
```
### Computation of performance figures
using explicit expression of $P(\underline{n})$ we have $p_m(k)= f_m(k)\frac{g(n-k,m-1)}{g(n,m)}$.
note: for the rest of the scheme $p_m(k,n)$ will be simplified in $p_m(k)$ omitting the explicit dependence with the size of the population. Here some perfomance indices that can be calculated:
- $X_m= \sum^{n}_{k=1}p_m(k)\frac{1}{S_m(k)} = V_m \frac{g(n-1,m)}{g(n,m)}$ 
- $U_m=1-p_m(0)=1- \frac{g(n,m-1)}{g(n,m)}$ 
notice that X and U can be also picked from the table produced by the computation of g.
- $\overline{n}_m = \sum^{n}_{k=1}kp_m(k)$ 
- $\overline{w}_m = \frac{\overline{n}_m}{X_m}$ 
In case of load indipendent station the following can be applied 
- $U_m= X_m S_m = V_m S_m \frac{g(n-1,m)}{g(n,m)}$ (standard formula)
- $\overline{n}_m(n)= U_m(n)[1+\overline{n}_m(n-1)]$ 
- $\overline{w}_m(n)= S_m[1+\overline{n}_m(n-1)]$ 

### Arrival theorem 
$\overline{w}(n)= S_m[1+\overline{n}_m(n-1)$ this is known as the Arrival theorem that states: "if a single server has a poisson input process then the arriving customers see the queue as if they were external observers not involved in this operation".

In the case of closed queueing networks with Product form solution the same theorem say: when network has n customers, arriving customer see queue i as external observers which monitor the queue in equilibrium when only n-1 customers are is the system
## Mean value analysis 
Let's group all the recurrent expression
-  $\overline{w}_i(n) = S_i[1+\overline{n}_i(n-1)]$
- $U_i(n)=X_i(n)S_i$ 
- $\overline{n}_i(n)= U_i(n)[1+\overline{n}_i(n-1)]$ 
The missing $X_i$ equation can be derived by using the little's law 
- $X_{ref}(n)= \frac{n}{\sum^{M}_{j=1}V_j \overline{w_j}(n)}$ (derived from the definition of $Y_k(n)$)   
- $X_i(n)= V_i X_{ref}(n)$ 
### MVA for LI stations

### Mean value analysis with delay stations
in the case of delay station $\overline{w}_i(n)= Z$ always. The algorithm can so modified observing that 
- $\overline{w}_i(n)= \begin{cases}Z_i \ \ \ delay\ station \\ S_i[1+\overline{n}_i(n-1)] \ \ \ LI \  station \end{cases}$  
- $\overline{n}_i(n)= \begin{cases}Z_iX_i(n) \ \ \ Delay \ Station \\ U_i(n)[1+\overline{n}_i(n-1)] \ \ \  LI \end{cases}$

### Mean value analysis with  Load dependent stations

consider the expression for the queue length distribution $p_m(k,n)= f_m(k)\frac{g(n-k,m-1)}{g(n,m)}$ , recall: the explicit expression of the service function $f_m(k)=V_mS_m(k)f_m(k-1)$  and throughput $X_m(n)= V_m \frac{g(n-1,m)}{g(n,m)}$  , substituting in the expression of queue length distribution we obtain  $p_m(k,n)= X_m(n)S_m(k)p_m(k-1,n-1)$ (intermediate passage omitted). since expression of $X_m$ hold for any index i we can use that expression for any index. The new recursive expression let us to obtain: 

- $\overline{w}_i(n) = \frac{\overline{n}_i}{X_i(n)} = \frac{\sum^{n}_{k=1}kp_i(k,n)}{X_i(n)} = \sum^{n}_{k=1}kS_i(k)p_i(k-1,n-1)$ latter passage with queue length distribution 
- $X_{ref}(n)= \frac{n}{\sum^{M}_{j=1}V_j \overline{w}_j(n)}$ 
- $X_i(n)= V_iX_{ref}(n)$ 
- $\overline{n}_i(n)=\overline{w}_i(n) * X_i(n)$ 
- $p_i(k,n)= X_i(n)S_i(k)p_i(k-1,n-1)$
- $p_i(0,n)= 1- \sum^{n}_{k=1}p_i(k,n)$ 
- $U_i(n)= 1-p_i(0,n)= \sum^{n}_{k=1}p_i(k,n)$ 

embedding these equation is easy, at each step the queue can be computed as $p_i(0,n)=1.0-U_i(n)$  and is initialized $p(0,0)=1.0$
